Project Description/Outline:
This project is to explore one of the most popular music streaming platforms, Spotify. We will be extracting, transforming, and loading data around artist popularity, song popularity, and most popular genres among Spotify users. 
 
 
Sources of Data: 
        Kaggle: Spotify Track DB
        Kaggle: Top Spotify Tracks of 2018


Data Cleanup & Analysis: 
1. Extract data files into a Dataframe using Python. 

2. Transform the dataframes

        a. Create a copy of the file
        b. Select the desired columns
        c. Rename the columns
        d. Clean up the data (remove any duplicates)
        
3. Load the Data: 

        a. Using Postgres, create the database and raw tables for data to be loaded into.
        b. Run the python file to create the connection, confirm the tables and load the dataframes into the database.
        
4. Create a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.
